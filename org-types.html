      <h2>Small Organizations</h2>
      <p>
        Small organizations often have limited IT budgets and fewer staff, which can make detailed disaster recovery and security planning feel overwhelming and even impossible. However, implementing even a basic plan can offer improved protection. Cloud-based services, third-party backups, and automated monitoring tools can help small teams achieve improved security without massive costs for the organization.

      <h2>Large Organizations</h2>
      <p>
        Large organizations compared to small organizations, operate with complex systems, multiple departments, and higher risks. Implementing a structured security and disaster recovery plan is crucial to protect their expansive data environment and meet industry compliance standards. These organizations often employ in-house security teams, redundancy systems, and advanced infrastructure monitoring. We are looking towards improving their already extensive security plans and making sure what they have is up to par.
