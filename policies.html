      <h2>Access Control Policies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User authentication and authorization:</strong> Systems should verify user identities and enforce permissions to ensure only authorized access to data and services.</li>
        <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong> Assigning access permissions based on user roles reduces the risk of unauthorized data exposure and simplifies permission management.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Enhances login security by requiring additional verification steps such as SMS codes or authentication apps.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Data Protection and Encryption</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data classification and handling:</strong> Sensitive and critical data should be labeled and handled according to its confidentiality level to ensure appropriate protection.</li>
        <li><strong>Data encryption:</strong> Both data-at-rest and data-in-transit should be encrypted using industry-standard algorithms to prevent unauthorized access or breaches.</li>
        <li><strong>Backup and recovery:</strong> Regular backups should be performed and stored securely with tested recovery strategies to ensure quick restoration in case of data loss.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Incident Response and Monitoring</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Threat detection and monitoring:</strong> Real-time monitoring tools should be used to detect anomalies, breaches, or other suspicious activity as early as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Incident response team:</strong> A trained team should be designated to handle security incidents with defined escalation and communication protocols.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-incident analysis:</strong> After an incident, a thorough review should be conducted to understand the root cause, improve systems, and prevent recurrence.</li>
      </ul>
