      <h2>Identifying Threats and Vulnerabilities</h2>
      <p>Organizations face a wide range of threats and vulnerabilities that must be identified to develop a strong security and disaster recovery plan.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cybersecurity threats:</strong> Includes malware, phishing attacks, ransomware, and other digital threats that compromise data and systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Physical threats:</strong> Such as natural disasters (earthquakes, floods), fire, theft, and vandalism that can damage infrastructure and disrupt operations.</li>
        <li><strong>System vulnerabilities:</strong> Software bugs, outdated systems, and unpatched hardware can be exploited, leading to data breaches and service interruptions.</li>
        <li><strong>FAIR Institute models:</strong> The FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) model provides a structured way to evaluate and quantify risk by analyzing potential loss events, frequency, and magnitude. It serves as a final deliverable in aligning risk with business goals.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Risk Impact Analysis</h2>
      <p>Risk impact analysis evaluates how different threats may affect the organization both operationally and financially.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Probability and impact:</strong> Each identified risk is assessed based on the likelihood of its occurrence and the potential impact it could have on operations and assets.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial and operational consequences:</strong> Risks may lead to lost revenue, legal penalties, loss of customer trust, and downtime that severely affects daily functions.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance and legal implications:</strong> Failing to address risks may result in violations of industry standards and regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, or ISO 27001, potentially leading to fines and legal action.</li>
      </ul>
