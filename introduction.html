      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In society, organizations face constant possibilites of security threats and operational risks. This Capstone explores the importance of implementing strong security measures alongside a well-structured disaster recovery plan. A proactive approach to both security and recovery not only protects critical data and systems but also ensures operational resilience during unexpected events.
      </p>
      <p>
        The objective of this project is to design a comprehensive website that outlines key components of a modern security and disaster recovery strategy. I chose this topic because of its relevance across industries and its critical role in sustaining business continuity in the face of cyber attacks, natural disasters, or system failures.
      </p>
    
      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Organizations today are highly dependent on digital infrastructure, making them vulnerable to a wide range of security threats which can range from data breaches and ransomware attacks to system failures and natural disasters. Unfortunately, many businesses either lack a formal disaster recovery strategy or have outdated plans that leave them exposed. Inadequate preparation can result in massive financial losses, reputational damage, and even regulatory penalties.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is an urgent need for companies to adopt effective, updated security policies and implement disaster recovery plans that are scalable and regularly tested. This project addresses those needs by providing a practical, structured solution.
      </p>
    
      <h2>Project Goals and Deliverables</h2>
      <p>
        The primary goal of this project is to create an accessible, informative website that demonstrates how to implement a security and disaster recovery plan tailored for different organizational needs. Deliverables include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A documented Security Plan outlining key policies and procedures.</li>
        <li>A Disaster Recovery Plan detailing response strategies and system recovery approaches.</li>
        <li>Implementation strategies for applying the plan across small and large organizations.</li>
        <li>Testing methodologies to ensure readiness and reliability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By bringing all these steps into one place, this project aims to improve awareness and preparedness around IT security and disaster recovery, offering tangible benefits such as reduced downtime, data integrity, and enhanced resilience.
